* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ModDuke_) used for managing contact details and meetings.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ModDuke` because it was initially created with similar functionality of the `Duke iP`, while modifying its functionality to suit NUS students.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ModDuke Product Website](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp)**.
* Our group is extending the functionality of the application to specifically serve NUS students managing many projects from different modules.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.A
