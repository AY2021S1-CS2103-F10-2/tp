## Project: Modduke

Modduke is a **desktop app targeted towards NUS students. It allows them to easily manage their contacts, modules and meetings during the semester.** The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a meeting add command to allow users to add a new meeting
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a meeting delete command to allow users to delete an existing meeting
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

* **New Feature**: Added a meeting edit command to allow users to edit an existing meeting
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
